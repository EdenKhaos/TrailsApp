# TrailsApp
A simplified application that displays local hiking trails depending on searched zip code. Once a zip code is searched, seven near by trails will be listed. For current area searched trail name, a picture of the trail, length of trail round trip, approximate time to get to trail, difficulty of trail, possible restaurants nearby, driving directions, and general weather info per trail.

## User Story
As AN active person living in Colorado during a pandemic,
I WANT an app that can show me hiking trails that I can access.
SO THAT his app would tell me about the difficulty of the trail, how far it is from me, how much of a time commitment it is, and possible near by restaurants.
